This is the Community Sensor Model base interface library.

Compilation
-----------
The CSM library can be compiled on Linux (tested on RHEL5) i386, x86_64, or IA-64, Solaris Sparc (32 or 64 bit, with or without the "stlport" mode) and x86, and Windows.  Use the appropriate Makefile when building.  For example:

  make -f Makefile.linux64 all install clean

By default, the built files are placed in an architecture subdirectory in the build area.  This allows multiple architectures to be built.  To specify a different intallation directory, set the INSTDIR make variable:

  make -f Makefile.linux64 all install clean INSTDIR=/path/to/csm3/install/dir

Compiling makes a 'csmapi' shared library (libcsmapi.so.3.0.3 on UNIX, csmapi.dll on Windows).  This library must be used when creating both CSM plugins and Sensor Exploitation Tools (SETs) that use CSM.
